README.txt


Part of Artificial Intelligence course.

Genetic Algorithm implementation by Bhakti Chauhan



individual.py includes all the basic GA function Definitions and TSP.py includes all the remaining selection, Crossover and mutation implementations respectively.









To run our genetic algorithms run TSP.py





The results is shown In the output screen.

Compiling Environment:
PyCharm CE

Compiling Steps:
Select the TSP.py File and click on RUN

Execution Instructions:
For different configuration call different functions in newGeneration() function which is defined in TSP.py
